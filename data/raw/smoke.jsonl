Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome Gastritis & Gastropathy View or Print All Sections Definition & Facts Gastritis and gastropathy are conditions that affect the stomach lining, also known as the mucosa. In gastritis, the stomach lining is inflamed. In gastropathy, the stomach lining is damaged, but little or no inflammation is present. Symptoms & Causes The majority of people with gastritis or gastropathy don’t have any symptoms. In some cases, gastritis and gastropathy cause symptoms of indigestion or of bleeding in the stomach. Helicobacter pylori infection is the most common cause of gastritis. Diagnosis Your doctor may order an upper GI endoscopy with biopsies or other tests to diagnose gastritis or gastropathy, find the cause, and check for complications. Other tests may include blood, stool, and breath tests and an upper GI series. Treatment Your doctor will recommend treatments based on the type of gastritis or gastropathy you have and its cause. Treating gastritis and gastropathy can improve symptoms, if present, and lower your chance of complications. Eating, Diet, & Nutrition Researchers have not found that eating, diet, and nutrition play an important role in causing the majority of cases of gastritis or gastropathy. H. pylori gastritis can cause problems absorbing iron from food, and autoimmune gastritis can cause problems absorbing iron and vitamin B12 from food. Clinical Trials The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) and other components of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) conduct and support research into many diseases and conditions.

Digestive System & How it Works Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome Peptic Ulcers (Stomach or Duodenal Ulcers) View or Print All Sections Definition & Facts A peptic ulcer, or stomach or duodenal ulcer, is a sore on the lining of your stomach or duodenum. Peptic ulcers can lead to complications such as bleeding, perforation, penetration, or blockage in your stomach or duodenum. Symptoms & Causes Common symptoms of peptic ulcers include pain or discomfort in your abdomen, feeling full too soon during or too full after a meal, nausea, bloating, and belching. The most common causes of peptic ulcers are Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Diagnosis Your doctor may ask about your medical and family history, perform a physical exam, and order tests to diagnose a peptic ulcer, find its cause, and check for complications. Doctors may order tests to check for Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection, upper gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy, and upper GI series. Treatment Doctors may recommend medicines to heal peptic ulcers and will look for and treat the underlying cause. Doctors treat Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection with medicines. If you have a peptic ulcer due to taking nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), your doctor may change your medicines. Eating, Diet, & Nutrition Researchers have not found that diet and nutrition play an important role in causing, preventing, or treating peptic ulcers. Doctors do not recommend following a special diet or avoiding specific foods or drinks to treat or prevent ulcers. Clinical Trials The NIDDK conducts and supports clinical trials in many diseases and conditions, including digestive diseases. The trials look to find new ways to prevent, detect, or treat disease and improve quality of life.
