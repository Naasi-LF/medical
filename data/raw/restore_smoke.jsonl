It is where digestion of protein begins. The stomach has three tasks. It stores swallowed food. It mixes the food with stomach acids. Then it sends the mixture on to the small intestine. Most people have a problem with their stomach at one time or another. Indigestion and heartburn are common problems. You can relieve some stomach problems with over-the-counter medicines and lifestyle changes, such as avoiding fatty foods or eating more slowly. Other problems like peptic ulcers or GERD require medical attention. You should see a doctor if you have any of the following: Blood when you have a bowel movement Severe abdominal pain Heartburn not relieved by antacids Unintended weight loss Ongoing vomiting or diarrhea NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases Start Here Stomach (Merck & Co., Inc.)

Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome Gastritis & Gastropathy View or Print All Sections Definition & Facts Gastritis and gastropathy are conditions that affect the stomach lining, also known as the mucosa. In gastritis, the stomach lining is inflamed. In gastropathy, the stomach lining is damaged, but little or no inflammation is present. Symptoms & Causes The majority of people with gastritis or gastropathy don’t have any symptoms. In some cases, gastritis and gastropathy cause symptoms of indigestion or of bleeding in the stomach. Helicobacter pylori infection is the most common cause of gastritis. Diagnosis Your doctor may order an upper GI endoscopy with biopsies or other tests to diagnose gastritis or gastropathy, find the cause, and check for complications. Other tests may include blood, stool, and breath tests and an upper GI series. Treatment Your doctor will recommend treatments based on the type of gastritis or gastropathy you have and its cause. Treating gastritis and gastropathy can improve symptoms, if present, and lower your chance of complications. Eating, Diet, & Nutrition Researchers have not found that eating, diet, and nutrition play an important role in causing the majority of cases of gastritis or gastropathy. H. pylori gastritis can cause problems absorbing iron from food, and autoimmune gastritis can cause problems absorbing iron and vitamin B12 from food. Clinical Trials The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) and other components of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) conduct and support research into many diseases and conditions. Related Conditions & Diseases Peptic Ulcers (Stomach Ulcers) Indigestion (Dyspepsia) Related Diagnostic Tests Upper GI Endoscopy Upper GI Series Your Digestive System & How It Works The digestive system is made up of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract-also called the digestive tract-and the liver, pancreas, and the gallbladder. The GI tract is a series of hollow organs joined in a long, twisting tube from the mouth to the anus. Related Research See more about digestive diseases research at NIDDK .
